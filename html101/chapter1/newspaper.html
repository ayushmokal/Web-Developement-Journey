<h2> Shopping List | Hot Dogs </h2>
<P> DOGS are more than our best friends. They're the ultimate travel<br>companions (they won't fight you for the arm rest on the plane),<br>and in today's age of handbag waiting lists, when trend-seeking label lovers are out to get the next big thing,there are certain<br>breeds that convey the kind of status that the Birkin bag<br>represents.(You have that dog! Where did you get it? And how?)<br>Finding the hottest four-legged creatures in town may require a bit<br> of travel. KAREN ROBINOVITZ</P>
